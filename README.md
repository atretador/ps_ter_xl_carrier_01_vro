as I enjoy the design of this ship quite a bit and the original author seems to be gone, I've decided to release an updated/tweaked version of it.

The original mod had quite a few issues - for instance, this ship was extremly fast for a carrier and packed way too many guns and way too little fighters.

This version tries to make it a proper carrier and place it at a nice mid point in between the ship its based on, the Honshu, and its competition, the Tokyo - with the following changes:

- Speed drasticaly nerfed, now its slightly faster than the Honshu (it was 2-3x faster in the original mod) and slower than the Tokyo.
- M dock capacity increased to 15; the original mod for some reason reduced this by a lot, now its the same as the Honshu.
- S dock capacity increased from 40 to 58.
- Drone capacity increased from 20 to 72 - 12 more than the Honshu.
- Missile capacity decreased from 400 to 100, matching the Honshu.
- Hull health increased from 277,000 to 325,000
- Cargo/container capacity increased from 18,000 to 48,000
- Removed from Terran shipyard, now exclusive to Pio.ï»¿
